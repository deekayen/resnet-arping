This was meant to be a signup form using arping and a
ISC dhcpd.leases file on an OpenBSD server for authenticating
students in campus housing. Priorities changed and the signup
form was postponed indefinately.

Right now it essentially parses the dhcpd.leases file to
get a MAC address to compare to the arping results. Both would
have to match to authenticate the user and put them in the system
to have their Cisco port activated.
